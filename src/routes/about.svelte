<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am <strong>Antonio Patriarca</strong> (he/him) and this is my blog. I am an Italian software developer in the VFX and Animation industry (at <a href="https://animallogic.com/">Animal Logic</a>). I have a MSc in Mathematics and a lot of interests. I will probably write about mathematics, programming, art, cooking, data visualization, etc. and include photos of my beautiful cat. ðŸ˜¸</p>

<p>I am not the best communicator and I am trying to get better. Writing on this blog is one of the ways I am trying to improve. I am however a very <strong>humble, polite and open-minded</strong> person. I always try to respect others and I am open to other people ideas, cultures, backgrounds, etc. I enjoy interacting with other people, particularly if I can learn something or challenge my own ideas and biases.</p>

<p>I am a very <strong>curious</strong> person. I am indeed always looking for new challenges, skills and knowledge. I have <strong>good analytical and mathematical skills</strong> and I enjoy applying these skills to new problems. I <strong>work well under pressure</strong> and I am never satisfied with superficial solutions and the status quo. I enjoy finding new <strong>creative</strong> solutions to old problems.</p>
